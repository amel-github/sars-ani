Contributing to SARS-ANI
================
April, 2022

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to SARS-ANI! We
want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible, whether it is:

-   Suggesting changes to the dataset
-   Suggesting changes to the code
-   Submitting new data
-   Contributing to the code

The SARS-ANI project uses GitHub to host data and code, receive new data
submission, track issues, and pull requests. Contributions are made to
this repository via <code>Issues</code> and <code>Pull Requests</code>.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the
contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

# Using the Issue tracker

The Issue tracker is the preferred channel for **suggesting changes** to
the **data** or to the **code** (e.g. reporting errors) and for
**submitting new SARS-CoV-2 events** to the dataset.<br>

### 1. Suggesting changes to the data

When you create an Issue to suggest changes to the dataset (e.g. report
an error), a template will be loaded that will guide you through
collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.<br>

-   Use a clear and descriptive title for the Issue to identify the
    problem. <br>  
-   Use the GitHub Issue search — check if the Issue has already been
    reported.<br>  
-   Check if the Issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the
    latest <code>master</code> or development branch in the
    repository.<br>
-   If you find an Issue that addresses the error you have spotted,
    please add your comment and information to the existing Issue rather
    than creating a new one.

### 2. Submitting new data

When you create an Issue to submit new data on SARS-CoV-2 event in
animals, a template will be loaded that will guide you through
collecting and providing the information we need.<br>  
Please, note that new data submitted without information source(s) will
not be considered. Please, provide the link to publicly available
information source or to your repository, cloud, etc. where the
information source can be accessed and downloaded. <br>

### 3. Suggesting changes to the code

-   Use a clear and descriptive title for the Issue to identify the
    problem. <br>  
-   Use the GitHub Issue search — check if the Issue has already been
    reported.<br>  
-   Check if the Issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the
    latest <code>master</code> or development branch in the
    repository.<br>  
-   Provide a clear and concise description of the error, including what
    you expected to happen.<br>

# How to make a clean pull request

A pull request can be done to **contribute to the code** developed to
visualize the dataset.

-   Create a personal fork of the project on Github.<br>  
-   Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is
    called <code>origin</code>.<br>  
-   Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.<br>  
-   If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream
    changes into your local repository.<br>  
-   Create a new branch to work on. Branch from <code>develop</code> if
    it exists, else from <code>master</code>.<br>  
-   Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.<br>  
-   Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.<br>  
-   Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote
    <code>origin</code>.<br>  
-   From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the
    project’s <code>develop</code> branch if there is one, else go for
    <code>master</code>.<br>  
-   If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your
    branch. The pull request will be updated automatically.<br>  
-   Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the
    changes from <code>upstream</code> to your local repo and delete
    your extra branch(es).<br>

Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit
message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code
– not what you did to the code.<br>
