## Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) most probably emerged from an animal source and subsequently spilled over to the human population in 2019, in China. Despite its zoonotic origin, the current COVID-19 pandemic is being sustained through human-to-human transmission. <br>  

Animal infections with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported by several countries. A wide range of animal species have proven to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 either via natural and/or experimental infection.  <br>  

Collecting and sharing data on reported SARS-CoV-2 natural infections in animals is of critical importance to assess their epidemiological significance for animal and human health, as well as their implications for biodiversity and conservation.  <br>  

```{r import, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Import the data
sars_df <- read.csv("sars_ani_data.csv", encoding="UTF-8") 

# Create a column "Date" where Date = date_confirmed and Date = date_reported if date_confirmed is missing and Date = date_published if the two others are missing.
# Remove trailing and leading white spaces
sars_df <- sars_df %>%
  mutate (Date = if_else(
    date_confirmed %in% c( "NS", NA,""), date_reported , date_confirmed)) %>%
   mutate (Date = if_else(
   Date %in% c( "NS", NA,""), date_published, Date)) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), str_trim)) 

# Transform the column "Date" into format Date that will be recognized in R
sars_df$Date <- as.Date(sars_df$Date , format = "%Y-%m-%d")

# Total number of unique reports included to extract the data
reports <- c(sars_df$archive_event_number, sars_df$secondary_source_ID)
unique_rep <- length(unique(reports))
```

## Overview of the Dataset
We consider as an **event** when one single case or several epidemiologically related cases were identified by the presence of viral RNA (proof of infection) and/or antibodies (proof of exposure) in an animal. Epidemiologically related cases include e.g. animals belonging to the same farm, captive animals housed together, pets belonging to the same household, or animals sampled within the same (generally transversal) study, featuring similar event and patient attributes, i.e. they underwent the same laboratory test(s) and showed the same results (including variant), exhibited the same symptoms and disease outcome, and were confirmed, reported (when applicable), and published on the same date (e.g. when pets of the same species sharing the same household showed different symptoms, they are reported as two distinct events). Events include follow-up history reports of outbreaks (e.g. follow-up on the clinical status of the animal, variant identification after case confirmation). <br>   

The SARS-ANI Dataset presents `r nrow(sars_df)` records of SARS-CoV-2 events in wild, farmed, domestic, and captive animals, which occurred between `r min(sars_df$Date)` and `r max(sars_df$Date)` and have been documented in `r length(unique(reports))` ProMED-mail and OIE-WAHIS reports. <br>   

Natural infections with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in `r length (unique(sars_df$species))` animal species, belonging to `r length(unique(sars_df$family))` families in `r length(unique(sars_df$country_name))` countries worldwide (covering `r length(unique(sars_df$subnational_administration))` subnational administrative areas).<br>   

The SARS-ANI dashboard, providing interactive visualizations of the dynamic version of the SARS-ANI Dataset, is available at: https://vis.csh.ac.at/sars-ani <br>   

\newpage

## Remarks
* The number of reported SARS-CoV-2 events in animals in each country depends on the reporting strategy of the country to the OIE, the intensity of the research and surveillance strategy in the different animal species (e.g. whether pets from infected households are systematically investigated or not), the media coverage on the diagnosed cases, and the uptake of the reported event by the ProMED-mail team. <br>  

* Number of cases and deaths in mink were inconsistently reported, therefore data on SARS-CoV-2 events in mink are partial and does not allow accurate estimation of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in the mink population. <br>

## How many SARS-CoV-2 cases (infections and/or exposures) have been reported per animal species? 

### Family, Latin name, common name of the animal species mentioned in the dataset, and reported number of SARS-CoV-2 cases.  <br> 

*Latin name for the species "hamster" is inconsistently reported and is therefore given the value "NS" when not specified.* <br>  
*Number of cases is reported inconsistently in mink (data on the number of cases in mink is missing most of the time). Therefore, the number of diagnosed cases is largely under-estimated in mink. This is also true for deer, but to a lesser extent.* <br>  
&nbsp;
```{r species_families, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table_species <- sars_df %>%
   filter (related_to_other_entries != "updated by") %>% # follow-up history reports are removed, only the last update is kept (so that the number of cases or outbreaks -depending on the question- is only counted once)
  mutate (number_cases = replace(number_cases, number_cases == "NS", 1)) %>% # change NS to 1 so that we count 1 case for each missing value. I put 1 so that the species appears on the graph.

  group_by(family, latin_name, species) %>% 
  summarise(number_cases_tot= sum(number_cases)) %>%

The dataset reports `r sum(table_species$number_cases_tot)` cases in total (we counted one case for any missing value on the number of cases).

## How many SARS-CoV2 cases (infections or exposures) have been reported per animal species and country?

The number of cases in mink is inconsistently (or even not at all) reported. Therefore, the number of cases shown here largely under-estimate the true number of cases in this species.

## How many animals have died directly or indirectly from SARS-CoV-2?
The figure below includes deaths that are directly related to an infection as well as deaths related to culling when implemented as control measure. <br>

## What is the case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the different animal species, per country? 
The case fatality rate (CFR) per species and country is obtained by dividing the total number of reported deaths in one species by the total number of reported cases for this species in the country. Animals culled as part of a control strategy are excluded (not all were diagnosed as infected). Similarly, mink are not included here because data on case and death numbers are partial. The CFR depends strongly on testing and does not give information on the infection fatality rate (IFR, number of deaths divided by the total number of infected individuals) or mortality rate (MR, number of deaths divided by the total at-risk population).<br>  
```{r fatality, fig.height=14, fig.width=18,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## What are the reported potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure in animals?
Several reports referred to "an undetected human case" as the most likely source of infection. Those were given the value "NS" in the dataset because the information was considered not specific enough. The source of infection was reported as "human” only when the report mentioned a contact with a confirmed human case as the most likely source of infection.
```{r sources, fig.height=10, fig.width=10, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Suspected sources of infection
sars_df %>%
   filter (related_to_other_entries != "updated by") %>% # follow-up history reports are removed, only the last update is kept (so that the number of cases or outbreaks -depending on the question- is only counted once)

## Which SARS-CoV-2 variants have been identified in the different animal species? 
The figures describe the number (and percentages) of **events** (one event may include one or more than one case).

variants_df <- sars_df %>%

Variants involved in SARS-CoV-2 events in animal were reported in `r round(perc.variants,1)`% of the events (`r nrow(variants_df)`/`r nrow(sars_df)`).

## What are the reported clinical signs allegedly associated to natural SARS-CoV-2 infections in the different animal species?

## What are the implemented control measures and possible outcomes after detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure in the different animal species?
The computed network is saved as an .html file (network.html) in the working directory. <br>  
The network shows, for each animal species (blue nodes), which control measures (yellow nodes) have been implemented in response to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks (e.g. treatment, culling, exclusion zone) and what was the outcome (red nodes) for the animals (e.g. death, recovery). <br>  
The size of each node in the network corresponds to the number of times the value appears in the dataset. <br>
